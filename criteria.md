# Acceptance criteria — Provenance Guard

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this service, written in unit 7
**before** you built it.

**All five are yours.** None are given.

An acceptance criterion names a number or something plainly observable. *"The
detector is accurate"* is an opinion — and perfect AI detection isn't possible
anyway, so it's an opinion about something nobody can deliver. *"Of 10 pieces I
wrote myself, at most 1 is labelled high-confidence AI"* is a criterion.

Under each, write a sentence or two on **why that target**. *"I allow at most 1
false positive in 10 because on a writing site a wrong accusation costs more
than a missed detection"* is a real answer.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## Pick numbers you can defend

**Cover at least three of these five areas.** They're prompts, not a form.

| Area | A question it could answer |
|---|---|
| False positives | How often may a human's writing get called AI? |
| Score spread | How far apart should clearly-AI and clearly-human text score? |
| Label coverage | Is every one of your three labels actually reachable? |
| The appeal path | Does an appeal always change status and always get recorded? |
| Bad input | What happens when `text` is missing, empty, or enormous? |

Two things worth knowing before you pick numbers:

- **The expensive mistake is one-sided.** Missing some AI text costs the site a
  little. Accusing a real writer costs that person a lot. A criterion that
  treats both errors as equally bad is describing a system nobody would ship.
- **Unit 8 tests across three trials, and the target has to hold across all
  three.** Your first signal runs a model, so identical input can score
  differently twice. A target of "at most 1 in 10" against trials of 2, 1, 2 is
  a **miss**.

## 1. False positives on my own writing

Of 10 pieces I wrote myself, at most 3 may be labeled high-confidence AI, in each of 3 runs.

**Why this target:** A wrong accusation costs the writer more than a missed AI post costs the site, so most of my own writing must not be called high-confidence AI. I set the cap at 3 rather than 1 because signal one treats plain, ordinary prose as predictable, and some of my own plain paragraphs may land there. Allowing 5 or more would make the label too easy to hit to mean anything.

---

## 2. Score spread between clear cases

In each of 3 runs, the confidence on `samples/clearly_ai.json` must be at least 0.15 higher than the confidence on `samples/clearly_human.json`.

**Why this target:** These two pieces are the clear cases. If their combined scores land within 0.15 of each other, the service is not separating writing I can already tell apart, and the labels on top of that score are a coin flip. The gap is on the combined confidence, not on signal one alone.

---

## 3. Label coverage

Submitting one piece aimed at each band returns all 3 labels, `human`, `ai`, and `unsure`, in each of 3 runs.

**Why this target:** A label that no score can reach is a label the service does not have. All three have to come back from real submissions, including the middle one, because a flip at 0.5 is not a confidence score.

---

## 4. The appeal path

An appeal with a real `content_id` and a non-empty reason returns status `under_review` and adds that reason to the log. An unknown id returns 404 and does not add an `under_review` line. I will check this by hand with curl, because `run_eval.py` only posts to `/submit`.

**Why this target:** Appeal is the only thing a writer can do when the service accuses them. If the status does not change, or the reason never hits the log, that person has no record and no next step.

---

## 5. Bad input

A missing `text`, an empty `text`, and a `text` longer than 4,000 characters each return 400 and do not add a `decided` log line.

**Why this target:** A blank or huge body should be rejected, not scored and labeled. The 4,000-character cutoff is the one in the endpoint contract: the model only reads about 400 tokens, and a slice of a long piece must not be judged as if it were the whole piece.

     UNIT 8 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath, like this:

         ## 2. Uncertain cases land in the unsure band

         The system handles uncertain cases well.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 8:** Text I judged borderline scores between
         > 0.4 and 0.6 in at least 4 of 5 cases.
         >
         > **Why revised:** "well" gave me nothing to check. I couldn't
         > reach a verdict from it at all.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "At most 1 of 10 of my own pieces flagged as AI" → "at most 3
            of 10", because 1 of 10 turned out to be hard.

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.
